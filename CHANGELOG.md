## 0.9.0 (February 20, 2024)

### New Features

- Support relative target completion (@kon72)
- Add support for launching an LSP (@cameron-martin)

### Bug fixes

- Make queries share the same server by default (@limdor)

## 0.8.1 (January 2, 2024)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix regressions caused by `bazel query` optimization in 0.8.0 (@daivinhtran)
- Add new and upcoming files names to the list of files marking the root of a repo / workspace (@hypdeb)

### Internal Improvements

- Migrate to eslint (@hypdeb)
- Upgrade typescript (@cameron-martin)

## 0.8.0 (December 15, 2023)

### New Features

- Add codelens support for running binary targets (@avx-rchung)

- WORKSPACE.bazel is now identified as starlark (@lalten)

- Add bazel.runTarget command for running targets (@romannikov)

- Add bazel.queryOutputBase configuration setting (@sheldonneuberger-sc)

  Changes where output_base is placed. This is convenient for when someone wants bazel using something other than TMPDIR. This is useful if you use a ramdisk for faster builds, or if your TMPDIR has space or security constraints.

- Add bazel.info.\* commands (@jfirebaugh)

  This command can be used in launch configurations to embed the results of `bazel info` values. For example:

      "initCommands": [
        "platform settings -w ${command:bazel.info.execution_root}",
      ]

### Bug Fixes

- Target completion no longer requires leading quotation mark (@kon72)
- Optimized performance of `bazel query` operations (@iamricard)
- CI updated to Node 20 (@jfirebaugh)

## 0.7.0 (December 6, 2022)

### New Features

- Add bazel.commandLine.queryExpression configuration setting (@maximMalofeev)

  A [query language expression](https://bazel.build/query/language) which determines the packages displayed in the workspace tree and quick picker. The default inspects the entire workspace, but you could narrow it. For example: `//part/you/want/...:*`

- Make executable and buildifierExecutable settings `machine-overridable` (@jfirebaugh)

  This allows them to be set in workspace or folder settings.

- Starlark syntax highlighting now applies to any file with a `.bazel` extension (@dierksen)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix and document providing flags to `getTargetOutput` (@jfirebaugh)

  Additional Bazel flags can be provided to the `bazel.getTargetOutput` command:

      "inputs": [
          {
              "id": "debugOutputLocation",
              "type": "command",
              "command": "bazel.getTargetOutput",
              "args": ["//my/binary:target", ["--compilation_mode", "dbg"]],
          }
      ]

## 0.6.0 (September 14, 2022)

### New Features

- Add bazel.getTargetOutput command.

  This command can be used in launch configurations to obtain the path to an executable built by Bazel. For example, you can set the "program" attribute of a launch configuration to an input variable:

      "program": "${input:binaryOutputLocation}"

  Then define a command input variable:

      "inputs": [
          {
              "id": "binaryOutputLocation",
              "type": "command",
              "command": "bazel.getTargetOutput",
              "args": ["//my/binary:target"],
          }
      ]

### Bug Fixes

- return `default` for .sky files in getBuildifierFileType (@arahatashun)

## 0.5.0 (October 29, 2021)

### New Features

- Implemented IntelliSense code completion for targets and packages in BUILD files.
- Added rudimentary goto definition handling for BUILD files.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed problems with CodeLens on Windows.
- Added support for "no-floating-promises" lint check and fixed violations.
- Made sure that multiple targets in CodeLens are sorted.

### Contributors

We would like to thank Alex Frasson, Chi Wang, ericisko, hensom, Jonathan Dierksen and Neil Ding for their great contributions.

## 0.4.1 (April 14, 2021)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix CVE-2021-22539: Malicious project can cause vscode-bazel to run arbitrary executable when linting a \*.bzl file.

## 0.4.0 (August 21, 2020)

### New Features

- CodeLens has been disabled by default, but can be enabled via a new option.

### Bug Fixes

- WORKSPACE.bazel files are now properly recognized.
- We made multiple improvements to Windows support.

## 0.3.0 (September 19, 2019)

### Breaking Changes

- This extension now requires Visual Studio Code 1.30 or higher.
- This extension now requires buildifier version 0.25.1 or higher.

### New Features

- Buildifier diagnostics have been refined. For example, now only the
  violating range of text is highlighted instead of the entire line.
- Added the "Copy Label to Clipboard" context menu option to the Bazel
  Build Targets view.
- The `.star` file extension is now recognized as Starlark for syntax
  highlighting.

### Bug Fixes

- Formatting a BUILD or Starlark file no longer deletes the editor's content
  if the file contains syntax errors.
- BUILD files named `BUILD.bazel` are now correctly treated as BUILD files,
  not `bzl` files, for the purposes of formatting and linting.

## 0.2.0 (May 15, 2019)

### New Features

- Support formatting of `*.BUILD` files.
- Bazel Build Targets view and Command Palette QuickPicks results are now
  sorted making them easy to scan.
- Targets rooted in the directory opened are also included in the TreeView
  and Command Palette QuickPicks.
- Support in the Bazel Build Targets view and Command Palette QuickPicks for
  building the whole package or the package recursively (`:all` and `/...`).

### Bug Fixes

- On Windows, clicking a target in the Bazel Build Targets view should now
  navigate to the BUILD file where that target is defined.
- The "Bazel: Build Target with Debugging" command has been renamed to
  "Bazel: Build Target with Starlark Debugger" to clarify that this command
  debugs the Starlark build rules themselves and not the binary/executable
  being built.
- Handle cases where `buildifier` exists with a non zero result, but did
  successfully run.
- Fix case where the Bazel executable wasn't properly defaulting.
- Packages created by otherwise empty `BUILD` files are now properly detected
  so the Bazel Build Targets matches the on-disk layout more closely.
- Fixed issue where VS Code would hang when the Bazel Build Targets view was
  opened and a workspace folder was _not_ part of a Bazel workspace.

## 0.1.0 (January 23, 2019)

### New Features

- CodeLens adds build/test commands to targets in the editor for BUILD files.
- If Buildifier is installed, it will be used as the formatter for BUILD,
  `.bzl`, and other Starlark files, and lint warnings will be annotated in
  the editor and problems panel.
- Targets in BUILD files are now treated as "symbols" so they appear in the
  Outline view, can be navigated to using the "Go to Symbol" command, and
  so forth.
- The "Bazel: Clean" command has been added to the command palette.
- The "Bazel Build Targets" explorer view now has an explicit refresh
  control to requery the workspace if there are changes that cannot be
  auto-detected.

### Bug Fixes

- Improve path resolution for breakpoints in local/external workspaces, which
  should solve some issues with the debugger not stopping when a breakpoint
  is reached.
- When a Bazel command is invoked from the command palette, a quick pick panel
  is now presented that allows the user to type or select which target should
  be built or tested.

## 0.0.2 (November 28, 2018)

- Fix an issue where runtime dependencies were listed as development dependencies.

## 0.0.1 (November 28, 2018)

- Initial release.
