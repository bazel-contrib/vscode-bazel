# Integration Testing & End-to-End Workflows Specification

## Purpose & Scope
This specification covers end-to-end integration testing for the complete Bazel build icon workflow, including user acceptance tests, real Bazel workspace testing, and comprehensive workflow validation from file selection to build completion.

## Technical Requirements
- **Language/Framework:** TypeScript with VS Code Extension Test Framework, real Bazel workspace fixtures
- **Dependencies:** Real Bazel installation, test workspace repositories, automated UI testing tools
- **Performance Requirements:** E2E test suite <5 minutes, individual workflow test <30s
- **Security Considerations:** Isolated test workspaces, cleanup of test artifacts

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create end-to-end test suite for complete build icon workflow
- [ ] Set up real Bazel workspace fixtures for realistic testing scenarios
- [ ] Implement automated UI interaction testing for icon clicks and menus
- [ ] Create integration tests for file-to-target resolution in real projects
- [ ] Add tests for build command execution with actual Bazel builds
- [ ] Implement visual state transition validation during real builds
- [ ] Create user acceptance tests for core user scenarios
- [ ] Add integration tests for configuration changes affecting behavior
- [ ] Implement cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Create regression tests for previously fixed bugs
- [ ] Set up automated CI/CD integration testing pipeline

## Dependencies
**Requires completion of:**
- [ ] features/command-integration.md
- [ ] testing/testing-framework.md

**Enables:**
- [ ] infrastructure/documentation-system.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete user workflows tested from start to finish
- [ ] Real Bazel integration works correctly across different project types
- [ ] Visual feedback and state transitions validated in realistic scenarios
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified through automated testing
- [ ] Performance requirements met in real-world usage scenarios
- [ ] Error handling tested with actual failure conditions
- [ ] Configuration changes properly affect integration behavior
- [ ] No critical issues identified in realistic usage patterns

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] End-to-end tests for file selection → target resolution → build execution
- [ ] Integration tests with various Bazel project structures (monorepo, multi-package)
- [ ] Integration tests for build success and failure scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests for context menu functionality and keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Integration tests for configuration system with real settings changes
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility tests (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Integration tests for build cancellation and error recovery
- [ ] User acceptance tests for primary user workflows

## Integration Points
- **Inputs:** 
  - Real Bazel workspace repositories for testing
  - Actual VS Code extension environment
  - Real user interaction simulation
  - Authentic Bazel build processes
- **Outputs:** 
  - End-to-end workflow validation results
  - Integration test coverage reports
  - Cross-platform compatibility results
  - Performance metrics from real usage scenarios
- **APIs/Interfaces:** 
  - VS Code Extension Test API for E2E testing
  - Real Bazel CLI for authentic build testing
  - VS Code UI automation for interaction testing
  - File system APIs for workspace manipulation

## Implementation Notes
- Use realistic Bazel projects that represent common usage patterns
- Implement proper test workspace isolation and cleanup
- Consider network dependencies and provide offline test modes
- Test with different Bazel versions to ensure compatibility
- Include both simple and complex project structures in test scenarios
- Validate that integration tests complement rather than duplicate unit tests
