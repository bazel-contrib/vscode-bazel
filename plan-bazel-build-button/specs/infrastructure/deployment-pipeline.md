# Deployment Pipeline & Release Management Specification

## Purpose & Scope
This specification covers the deployment pipeline, release preparation, marketplace publication, monitoring systems, and post-deployment feedback collection for the Bazel build icon feature release.

## Technical Requirements
- **Language/Framework:** VS Code Extension packaging, marketplace deployment tools, CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependencies:** vsce (VS Code Extension CLI), marketplace publishing account, CI/CD platform
- **Performance Requirements:** Package build <2 minutes, deployment <5 minutes, rollback capability <10 minutes
- **Security Considerations:** Secure API keys and publishing credentials, signed packages, vulnerability scanning

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Set up automated extension packaging with vsce CLI
- [ ] Create version bumping and changelog generation automation
- [ ] Implement pre-release testing pipeline with all test suites
- [ ] Set up VS Code marketplace publishing automation
- [ ] Create deployment rollback procedures and emergency processes
- [ ] Implement post-deployment monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Set up user feedback collection and issue tracking integration
- [ ] Create release notes generation from changelog and commits
- [ ] Implement feature flag system for gradual feature rollout
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning and dependency checking
- [ ] Create deployment metrics and analytics collection

## Dependencies
**Requires completion of:**
- [ ] infrastructure/documentation-system.md

**Enables:**
- [ ] Production deployment and user access

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline works reliably without manual intervention
- [ ] Extension packages correctly and passes all marketplace validation
- [ ] Pre-deployment testing catches critical issues before release
- [ ] Rollback procedures work quickly and effectively in emergency situations
- [ ] Post-deployment monitoring provides real-time health and usage metrics
- [ ] User feedback collection enables rapid issue identification and resolution
- [ ] Release process documentation enables team members to manage deployments
- [ ] Security scanning identifies and blocks vulnerable dependencies

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Integration tests for entire deployment pipeline
- [ ] Validation tests for extension packaging and marketplace submission
- [ ] Rollback procedure testing in staging environment
- [ ] Performance tests for deployment pipeline execution time
- [ ] Security tests for credential handling and package signing
- [ ] End-to-end tests for complete release workflow
- [ ] Monitoring system validation and alert testing
- [ ] User feedback system integration testing

## Integration Points
- **Inputs:** 
  - Completed feature implementation from all specifications
  - Documentation and marketplace assets
  - Version control system state and release tags
  - Configuration and secrets for marketplace publishing
- **Outputs:** 
  - Published VS Code extension on marketplace
  - Release notes and version documentation
  - Deployment metrics and monitoring data
  - User feedback and issue tracking integration
- **APIs/Interfaces:** 
  - VS Code Marketplace Publishing API
  - vsce CLI for extension packaging
  - CI/CD platform APIs for automation
  - Monitoring and analytics service integration

## Implementation Notes
- Follow VS Code marketplace publishing guidelines and best practices
- Implement proper semantic versioning for releases and compatibility
- Use feature flags to enable gradual rollout and quick issue mitigation
- Maintain staging environment that mirrors production for testing
- Document all deployment procedures for team knowledge sharing
- Consider marketplace review times and plan releases accordingly
