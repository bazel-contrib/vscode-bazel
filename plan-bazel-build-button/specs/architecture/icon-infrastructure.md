# Icon Infrastructure Specification

## Purpose & Scope
This specification covers the foundational icon infrastructure for the VS Code Bazel build icon feature, including the StatusBar icon component, state management system, and basic visual feedback mechanisms.

## Technical Requirements
- **Language/Framework:** TypeScript VS Code Extension with Node.js runtime
- **Dependencies:** VS Code Extension APIs (vscode.StatusBarItem, vscode.commands, vscode.workspace)
- **Performance Requirements:** Icon state transitions <100ms, minimal memory footprint
- **Security Considerations:** No sensitive data exposure through icon tooltips or states

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create `BazelBuildIcon` class to encapsulate StatusBarItem functionality
- [ ] Implement `IconState` enum with states: Idle, Building, Success, Error, Disabled
- [ ] Design SVG icon assets for each state (green Bazel logo variants)
- [ ] Create `IconStateManager` class for state transitions and validation
- [ ] Implement workspace detection integration using `BazelWorkspaceInfo`
- [ ] Add icon visibility toggle based on workspace presence
- [ ] Create tooltip system with contextual status messages
- [ ] Add configuration property for icon enable/disable in package.json
- [ ] Implement icon click event handling infrastructure
- [ ] Create unit tests for state transitions and icon behavior

## Dependencies
**Requires completion of:**
- [ ] None (Foundation component)

**Enables:**
- [ ] features/command-integration.md
- [ ] features/visual-feedback.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Icon appears in status bar only when Bazel workspace is detected
- [ ] Icon state changes are visually smooth and responsive (<100ms)
- [ ] Icon disappears when switching to non-Bazel workspace
- [ ] Tooltip displays accurate status information for each state
- [ ] Icon can be disabled via VS Code settings
- [ ] Icon click events are properly captured and can be handled
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during state transitions

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for `BazelBuildIcon` class methods
- [ ] Unit tests for `IconState` enum transitions
- [ ] Unit tests for `IconStateManager` state validation
- [ ] Integration tests for workspace detection behavior
- [ ] Visual regression tests for icon appearance in different states
- [ ] Performance tests for state transition timing

## Integration Points
- **Inputs:** 
  - Workspace change events from VS Code
  - BazelWorkspaceInfo detection results
  - Configuration changes from VS Code settings
- **Outputs:** 
  - Visual icon state in status bar
  - Click events for command execution
  - Status information via tooltips
- **APIs/Interfaces:** 
  - `vscode.StatusBarItem` for icon display
  - `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders` for workspace events
  - Configuration API for enable/disable settings

## Implementation Notes
- Use VS Code's built-in theme-aware icon coloring where possible
- Implement proper cleanup for StatusBarItem disposal
- Consider icon accessibility with high contrast themes
- Cache icon states to prevent unnecessary DOM updates
- Follow VS Code extension guidelines for status bar item priority and alignment
