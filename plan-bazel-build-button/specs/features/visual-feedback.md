# Visual Feedback & User Experience Specification

## Purpose & Scope
This specification covers the responsive UI feedback system, build progress animations, success/error state indicators, context menus, keyboard shortcuts, and overall user experience enhancements for the Bazel build icon feature.

## Technical Requirements
- **Language/Framework:** TypeScript VS Code Extension with Node.js runtime
- **Dependencies:** VS Code UI APIs (Progress, Notifications, Context Menus, Keybindings)
- **Performance Requirements:** Animation updates <16ms (60fps), notification display <100ms
- **Security Considerations:** No sensitive build information exposed in notifications or tooltips

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Implement build progress spinner animation during building state
- [ ] Create success/error state indicators with automatic timeout (3-5 seconds)
- [ ] Add build failure notification system with actionable error messages
- [ ] Implement right-click context menu with additional build options
- [ ] Create keyboard shortcut support for build current file command
- [ ] Add build output integration with click-to-view-details functionality
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when Bazel is unavailable
- [ ] Create progress reporting integration with VS Code Progress API
- [ ] Add customizable notification preferences (show/hide success, errors only)
- [ ] Implement icon animation states and smooth transitions
- [ ] Create unit tests for all visual feedback components

## Dependencies
**Requires completion of:**
- [ ] features/command-integration.md

**Enables:**
- [ ] features/configuration-system.md
- [ ] testing/integration-testing.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Visual feedback is immediate and informative for all user actions
- [ ] Error states provide actionable guidance with clear next steps
- [ ] Context menu enhances workflow without cluttering the interface
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work reliably and are discoverable
- [ ] Progress animations are smooth and don't interfere with VS Code performance
- [ ] Notifications are appropriately timed and dismissible
- [ ] Graceful fallback behavior when Bazel is not available
- [ ] Visual consistency with VS Code design language and themes

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for progress animation components
- [ ] Unit tests for notification system behavior
- [ ] Unit tests for context menu functionality and actions
- [ ] Unit tests for keyboard shortcut registration and handling
- [ ] Visual regression tests for icon states and animations
- [ ] Integration tests for user interaction workflows
- [ ] Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen readers
- [ ] Performance tests for animation frame rates and responsiveness

## Integration Points
- **Inputs:** 
  - Build progress events from command execution
  - Build success/failure results
  - User interaction events (right-click, keyboard shortcuts)
  - Configuration changes for notification preferences
- **Outputs:** 
  - Visual progress indicators and animations
  - User notifications with build results
  - Context menu actions and commands
  - Keyboard command execution
- **APIs/Interfaces:** 
  - `vscode.window.withProgress` for progress reporting
  - `vscode.window.showInformationMessage/showErrorMessage` for notifications
  - `vscode.commands.registerCommand` for context menu actions
  - Package.json keybindings for keyboard shortcuts

## Implementation Notes
- Use VS Code's native progress API for consistent user experience
- Implement context menu conditionally based on current file and workspace state
- Follow accessibility guidelines for keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Consider user preferences for notification frequency and verbosity
- Ensure animations degrade gracefully on lower-performance systems
- Maintain visual consistency across different VS Code themes and display settings
