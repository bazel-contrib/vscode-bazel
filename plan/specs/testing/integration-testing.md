## Testing Requirements

### Integration Test Suites

#### End-to-End Workflow Tests
- [ ] Project view file creation → configuration → build execution
- [ ] Directory filtering → file explorer interaction → build target resolution
- [ ] Test source configuration → test discovery → test execution
- [ ] Status bar updates → user interaction → command execution
- [ ] Error detection → user notification → resolution workflow

#### Performance Test Suites
- [ ] Large repository simulation with varying file counts (10K, 100K, 600K+ files)
- [ ] Memory usage profiling during different operations
- [ ] Response time measurement for all user interactions
- [ ] Concurrent operation testing (multiple builds, file watching)
- [ ] Resource cleanup validation after operations

#### Regression Test Suites
- [ ] Existing build functionality without project view
- [ ] Legacy status bar behavior preservation
- [ ] Existing test discovery and execution
- [ ] File target resolution fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Extension activation and deactivation scenarios

### Performance Benchmarking

#### Load Time Benchmarks
```typescript
describe('Project View Load Performance', () => {
  test('Repository with 600K files loads in <3s', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    await loadProjectView(largeRepositoryFixture);
    const loadTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(3000);
  });
});
```

#### Memory Usage Validation
```typescript
describe('Memory Usage Optimization', () => {
  test('Filtered view reduces memory usage by 60%+', async () => {
    const beforeMemory = process.memoryUsage().heapUsed;
    await enableDirectoryFiltering(projectViewConfig);
    const afterMemory = process.memoryUsage().heapUsed;
    const reduction = (beforeMemory - afterMemory) / beforeMemory;
    expect(reduction).toBeGreaterThan(0.6);
  });
});
```

#### Target Resolution Performance
```typescript
describe('Target Resolution Performance', () => {
  test('Project view targets resolve in <500ms', async () => {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    const targets = await resolveProjectViewTargets(projectViewConfig);
    const resolutionTime = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(resolutionTime).toBeLessThan(500);
    expect(targets).toHaveLength(expectedTargetCount);
  });
});
```

## Implementation Notes

### Test Environment Architecture
Create comprehensive test environment:
```typescript
class ProjectViewTestEnvironment {
  private workspace: TestWorkspace;
  private extension: TestExtension;
  
  async setup(config: TestConfiguration): Promise<void> {
    await this.createTestWorkspace(config);
    await this.loadExtension();
    await this.setupProjectView(config.projectView);
  }
  
  async teardown(): Promise<void> {
    await this.cleanup();
    await this.validateResourceCleanup();
  }
}
```

### Large Repository Simulation
Generate test data for performance validation:
```typescript
async function generateLargeRepository(fileCount: number): Promise<TestWorkspace> {
  const workspace = new TestWorkspace();
  
  // Generate directory structure
  for (let i = 0; i < fileCount / 100; i++) {
    await workspace.createDirectory(`dir_${i}`);
    
    // Create files in each directory
    for (let j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
      await workspace.createFile(`dir_${i}/file_${j}.ts`, generateFileContent());
    }
  }
  
  return workspace;
}
```

### Performance Monitoring Integration
Implement continuous performance monitoring:
```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  private metrics: PerformanceMetric[] = [];
  
  startMeasurement(operation: string): PerformanceMeasurement {
    return new PerformanceMeasurement(operation, performance.now());
  }
  
  recordMemoryUsage(operation: string): void {
    const usage = process.memoryUsage();
    this.metrics.push(new MemoryMetric(operation, usage));
  }
  
  generateReport(): PerformanceReport {
    return new PerformanceReport(this.metrics);
  }
}
```

### Regression Testing Framework
Automated regression detection:
```typescript
describe('Regression Tests', () => {
  beforeEach(async () => {
    await setupLegacyWorkspace(); // Without project view
  });
  
  test('Build icon functionality unchanged', async () => {
    const result = await executeBuildCommand();
    expect(result).toMatchLegacyBehavior();
  });
  
  test('Status bar displays correctly', async () => {
    const statusBar = await getStatusBarState();
    expect(statusBar).toMatchLegacyFormat();
  });
});
```
