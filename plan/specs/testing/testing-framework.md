# Testing Framework & Unit Tests Specification

## Purpose & Scope
This specification covers the comprehensive test suite setup for all components of the Bazel build icon feature, including unit testing framework, test utilities, mock systems, and performance testing infrastructure.

## Technical Requirements
- **Language/Framework:** TypeScript with Jest/Mocha testing framework, VS Code Extension Test Framework
- **Dependencies:** @vscode/test-cli, sinon for mocking, test workspace fixtures
- **Performance Requirements:** Test suite execution <30s, individual test <1s, code coverage >95%
- **Security Considerations:** Isolate test environments, secure test data handling

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Set up VS Code extension testing framework with @vscode/test-cli
- [ ] Create unit test suite for FileTargetResolver with various project structures
- [ ] Implement mock Bazel CLI responses for consistent testing
- [ ] Create unit tests for BazelBuildIcon state management and transitions
- [ ] Add unit tests for IconStateManager validation logic
- [ ] Implement performance tests for target resolution and caching
- [ ] Create edge case tests for missing BUILD files and malformed targets
- [ ] Add memory leak detection tests for icon state management
- [ ] Implement test fixtures for different workspace configurations
- [ ] Create automated test data generation for complex scenarios
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting and enforcement

## Dependencies
**Requires completion of:**
- [ ] features/file-target-resolver.md

**Enables:**
- [ ] testing/integration-testing.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage >95% for core functionality
- [ ] All edge cases handled gracefully with appropriate tests
- [ ] Performance requirements validated through automated tests
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during extended test runs
- [ ] Test suite runs reliably in CI/CD environment
- [ ] Mock systems accurately simulate real Bazel behavior
- [ ] Test data covers common and uncommon project structures
- [ ] Test execution time meets performance requirements

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all FileTargetResolver methods and edge cases
- [ ] Unit tests for BUILD file traversal logic with various directory structures
- [ ] Unit tests for Bazel query parsing and error handling
- [ ] Unit tests for target caching behavior with TTL validation
- [ ] Unit tests for icon state management and transition validation
- [ ] Performance tests for large codebase scenarios (1000+ files)
- [ ] Memory profiling tests for caching and state management
- [ ] Concurrency tests for simultaneous target resolution requests

## Integration Points
- **Inputs:** 
  - Test workspace fixtures with various Bazel project structures
  - Mock Bazel CLI responses for different query scenarios
  - Test configuration files for various edge cases
  - Performance test data sets
- **Outputs:** 
  - Test execution results and coverage reports
  - Performance metrics and benchmarks
  - Memory usage profiles
  - Error condition validation results
- **APIs/Interfaces:** 
  - VS Code Extension Test API for extension testing
  - Jest/Mocha test framework APIs
  - Sinon mocking framework for CLI simulation
  - Code coverage tools integration

## Implementation Notes
- Use VS Code's recommended testing patterns for extension development
- Create reusable test utilities for common scenarios
- Implement proper test isolation to prevent cross-test interference
- Use deterministic test data to ensure consistent results
- Consider test execution parallelization for faster CI/CD runs
- Maintain test documentation alongside implementation tests
