## Implementation Workflow

1. **Foundation Phase:** Complete architecture and infrastructure specifications
   - Establish project view file parsing capabilities
   - Update extension metadata and branding

2. **Core Development Phase:** Parallel execution of feature specifications
   - Build icon integration for project view targets
   - Directory filtering for large repository performance
   - Test integration with VS Code Test Explorer
   - Command implementation for file management

3. **Integration Phase:** Status bar integration and user experience
   - Project view status indicators
   - Error reporting and validation feedback

4. **Validation Phase:** Execute comprehensive testing
   - Integration testing across all components
   - Performance testing for large repositories (600K+ files)
   - Regression testing for existing functionality

## Performance Targets

All specifications must contribute to achieving these KPIs:
- **Load Time:** Project explorer population <3s (baseline: >30s for full repo)
- **Target Resolution:** <500ms for project view targets
- **Memory Usage:** 60%+ reduction when using directory filtering
- **Compatibility:** Zero regressions in existing Bazel extension functionality
