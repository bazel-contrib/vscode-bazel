# Configuration & Advanced Features Specification

## Purpose & Scope
This specification covers the user configuration system, advanced feature options, target history functionality, build cache status indication, and workspace-specific configuration overrides for the Bazel build icon feature.

## Technical Requirements
- **Language/Framework:** TypeScript VS Code Extension with Node.js runtime
- **Dependencies:** VS Code Settings API, local storage for history, workspace configuration
- **Performance Requirements:** Settings loading <50ms, history persistence <100ms
- **Security Considerations:** Validate configuration values, secure storage of workspace-specific settings

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Add configuration properties to package.json contributes.configuration section
- [ ] Implement user preference for auto-detect vs manual target selection mode
- [ ] Create build output visibility controls (show/hide terminal on build)
- [ ] Implement target history tracking with quick re-run functionality
- [ ] Add build cache status indication as optional feature
- [ ] Create support for custom Bazel commands beyond basic build (test, run)
- [ ] Implement workspace-specific configuration override system
- [ ] Add telemetry collection for feature usage analytics (optional)
- [ ] Create configuration validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement settings migration for future version updates
- [ ] Create unit tests for all configuration components

## Dependencies
**Requires completion of:**
- [ ] features/visual-feedback.md

**Enables:**
- [ ] infrastructure/documentation-system.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All configuration options work as documented and persist across sessions
- [ ] Advanced features enhance workflow without complicating basic usage
- [ ] Settings are properly validated with helpful error messages
- [ ] Workspace-specific overrides function correctly and don't conflict with global settings
- [ ] Target history provides quick access to recently built targets
- [ ] Build cache status (if enabled) accurately reflects cache state
- [ ] Feature usage analytics (if enabled) collect meaningful usage data
- [ ] Settings UI integrates seamlessly with VS Code preferences interface

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for configuration property loading and validation
- [ ] Unit tests for target history functionality and persistence
- [ ] Unit tests for workspace-specific configuration overrides
- [ ] Unit tests for settings migration logic
- [ ] Integration tests for configuration changes affecting build behavior
- [ ] Integration tests for advanced feature workflows
- [ ] Edge case tests for malformed or conflicting configuration values
- [ ] Performance tests for settings loading and history operations

## Integration Points
- **Inputs:** 
  - User configuration changes from VS Code settings
  - Target build history from previous executions
  - Workspace configuration files
  - Build cache status from Bazel (if enabled)
- **Outputs:** 
  - Configured behavior for build operations
  - Quick access to historical targets
  - Customized build command execution
  - Analytics data collection (if enabled)
- **APIs/Interfaces:** 
  - `vscode.workspace.getConfiguration` for settings access
  - `vscode.ExtensionContext.globalState` for history persistence
  - `vscode.workspace.getWorkspaceFolder` for workspace-specific configs
  - Package.json configuration schema for settings definition

## Implementation Notes
- Provide sensible defaults for all configuration options
- Use VS Code's configuration schema validation where possible
- Implement graceful fallbacks when advanced features are disabled
- Consider configuration complexity vs. user benefit trade-offs
- Follow VS Code configuration naming conventions and grouping
- Ensure configuration changes take effect without requiring extension restart
